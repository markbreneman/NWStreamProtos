***Three protos;***

1. Using the JW Player and HTML cover. Pressing 'p' simulates the stream starting.  On Error/streamstop the cover div comes back.
2. Uses Youtube livestreaming with a fixed URL.  Switchout Channel ID  for the desired Youtube channel.  The livestream must be public 🙁, but can be stopped and restarted at any time.
3. Uses Vimeo livestreaming with a fixed url and unlisted stream.  You create an event on vimeo thats unlisted, and start/stop streaming to that live  event. You  just need to swtich out the  *<iframe src="https://vimeo.com/event/1487450/embed/d7e02e2782"* with your  iframe event embed code.
